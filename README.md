No mining crypto in your basement 😭

This is a **fun side project**.

Source code is **fully open**. You can build it, tweak it, or read every line.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- FPS is measured using update intervals — close enough for human eyes  
- Ping is estimated using Google (⚠️ not super accurate but does the job)  
- 1% Low is updated every 5s (in Pro only)  

It's meant to be light, not NASA-tier accurate.
