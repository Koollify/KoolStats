## 🤔 How Accurate Is KoolStats?

Look, it’s not NASA-level accurate.

We don’t have access to your game engine, your GPU drivers, or your pet hamster’s emotions.  
But KoolStats gives you a **good enough** idea of how your game is doing:

- FPS = based on update timing (close enough for humans)
- Ping = estimated from google.com (not perfect, but works for most)
- 1% Low = real, but chill — not a benchmark chart

> If you're looking for pixel-perfect analysis, download MSI Afterburner.  
> If you're just wondering “am I lagging rn?”, KoolStats got you ✅



## 💡 Why KoolStats?

Because:
- Shift+F5 covers half your screen
- Most games hide ping
- FPS counters kill your FPS
- You just want simple stats that work
