## 🧠 Why KoolStats Exists

Because:
- Roblox's Shift+F5 covers 40% of your screen
- Some games hide your ping like it’s a government secret
- Every other FPS overlay looks like a spaceship UI from 1997
- Your PC runs Windows 11 but lags like it’s on Windows XP

---

## ✅ What KoolStats Shows

- ✔️ FPS (updates every 3 sec or 1 sec if you go Pro)
- ✔️ Ping (Google-based, ghetto but effective)
- ✔️ 1% Low (in Pro ver, updates every 5s)
- ✔️ Vibes (constant)

## ⚒️ How KoolStats Works

- FPS = display refresh based on update timing
- Ping = ping to `google.com` (yes it’s janky, no it doesn’t matter)
- 1% Low = average of the worst frames, updated every 5s
- All of this? Wrapped in a floating draggable/resizable box that sips RAM like tea 🫖

## 🔐 Security Talk (for the paranoid)

> Is it safe??

YES. Chill.  
- No viruses  
- No background mining  
- No hidden files  
- You can read every line on GitHub  
- Not even compiled by default, so u build it urself if u got trust issues 😭

## 📦 How To Use

1. Download `.exe` from [Releases](#)
2. Double click it
3. Boom. Done.  

No installer. No tray icon. No registry edits. No drivers.  
It’s just text. It floats. It updates. That's it.

## 🐸 What People Are *Probably* Saying

> “Bro why is this so clean?”  
> “I thought this was gonna lag me but it didn’t”  
> “My FPS dropped to 4 and it told me in red... helpful, but hurtful”  
> “It’s like a gamer Tamagotchi that just says FPS”
