## 🖥 Works With:
- Roblox ✅
- Valorant ✅
- Minecraft ✅
- Even your aunt’s 2012 netbook ✅  
> If it opens a game, KoolStats probably works on it.

## 🧼 Is It Safe?

Yes bruh.  
No virus. No crypto miner. No weird stuff watching you type.

I don’t make money off this.  
There’s no ads. No paywall. No “premium tier.”  
I’m 12, not a Silicon Valley CEO 😭

> KoolStats ain’t an exploit, cheat, or magic booster.  
> It’s not like Bloxstrap (safe launcher) or Evon (💀).  
> It’s just a tiny stats thing so you don’t suffer in silence.

## 🔒 Wanna double check?

- ✅ Code is public on GitHub  
- ✅ You can build it yourself  
- ✅ KoolStats only shows FPS + Ping — that’s it

Check the code. It’s literally all right there.  
If it was sketchy, I’d be banned already 💀

## 📁 How to Use

1. Download from [Releases](#) (when I upload it... chill)
2. Run `.exe`
3. Boom. Stats show. Right-click for settings (if you're fancy)

> ⚠️ No tray icons  
> ⚠️ No background processes  
> ✅ Just vibes

## 🤔 Accuracy?

Not perfect. But good enough.

- FPS = measured by a humble clock  
- Ping = we ask Google like "yo how fast am I?"  
- 1% Low = guesswork but not totally useless  

> Wanna be NASA? Go get MSI Afterburner.  
> Wanna know if your PC just died? KoolStats got u.

## 💡 Why KoolStats?

- Because Shift+F5 on Roblox be looking like a whole PowerPoint
- Because Valorant hides your suffering
- Because most overlays drop FPS while showing FPS
- Because I wanted something small that just works.
