## 🧊 What is KoolStats?

KoolStats is a no-nonsense stats HUD that shows:

- ✅ FPS  
- ✅ Ping  
- ✅ *(Optional)* 1% Low FPS  

with **no graphs, no bloat, no lag**. Just pure stats, baby.

## 🧼 Is It Safe?

YEAH. KoolStats is **100% clean**:  
- No viruses  
- No miners  
- No keyloggers  
- No background weirdness  
- No sus 🧍

Just open-source overlay magic.  
You can even read the code if you're paranoid 😌

---

## 🤔 Accuracy?

Look bro — it ain’t NASA level, but:

- **FPS** = calculated per frame  
- **Ping** = tested with google.com  
- **1% Low** = basic frame drop calc every 5 seconds  

If you want pixel-perfect benchmarking, go download MSI Afterburner 😤  
This one is for real gamers who just wanna know:  
> “am I lagging rn??”

## 🧃 Why KoolStats?

because:
- shift+F5 covers half your screen  
- roblox hides ping  
- overlays tank fps  
- you want a cute clean stat box, not a NASA dashboard
